Build scripts for PDFium
========================

PDFium is an open-source PDF rendering engine: https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/

This repository contains build scripts for Linux and Windows, to build a custom
patched version of PDFium that can be used with the GDAL PDF driver.
This is a slightly modified version of the PDFium sources, for GDAL needs.

# Linux

Tested with Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 with development packages for zlib, libjpeg, libpng,
libopenjp2 and and other development tools (git)

Run ./build_linux.sh.

It will generate the install/ directory with the end products: header files
and libpdfium.a needed to build the GDAL PDF driver

# Windows

Tested with Windows 10, with Visual Studio 2019 community edition, x86_64 build.
Windows 10 SDK >= 10.0.22621.2428 with the "Debugging Tools for Windows SDK 10" must also be installed.

Run "git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git"
from this repository, which will create a depot_tools subdirectory.

Then run "git checkout 85ec2718b5a29990c7eb67778348c9f76a00f392" in that
subdirectory.

Run build_win.bat from cmd.exe with the environment variables set for the compiler
you use (or from the "x64 Native tools Command Prompt for VS2019" entry)

Note: if the console remains stuck on the stage
"""Downloading CIPD client for windows-amd64 from https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/client?platform=windows-amd64&version=git_revision:89ada246fcbf10f330011e4991d017332af2365b..."""
and multiple error messages mentionning it can not be downloaded,
just manually download the file at the above URL, rename it as .cipd_client.exe in the depot_tools directory
and re-run build_win.bat

It will generate the install/ directory with the end products: header files
and pdfium.lib needed to build the GDAL PDF driver.
